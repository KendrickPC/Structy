# Structy
## Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms:

Hello fellow programmers of the future! 
I'm writing this to share my answers (most of my answers are not the same as Structy's given solutions).
When I started out, I had difficulty understanding the simple concepts of data structures and algorithms.
However, after ordering the premium edition of Structy, I have greatly improved on my fundamental understanding.
I highly recommend you go and subscribe to the premium edition - the solution walkthroughs are the best I've found on the internet. #trueStory
Happy Coding y'all!
